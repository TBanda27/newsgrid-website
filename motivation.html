                        <p>If you want to inspire others, always communicate your why first. This is Simon’s key idea in a nutshell: “People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” Every company in the world knows what they do, which is why it’s
                            the first thing they tell people about. But rationale is a weak way of trying to get us to make decisions, probably the weakest of them all. That’s because emotions trump reason every time. When we make a decision based on
                            a strong why, we own it. Only when we know why we do things, will we feel a sense of belonging, and that’s why it’s a much more powerful way of getting us to decide.. </p>
                        <p>
                            The best businesses are built by excited employees. Which business wouldn’t want their employees to go above and beyond for the company’s success? The way you do it is by building your business around a cause, and then assembling people who share your
                            why. Instead of relying on big paychecks, threatening deadlines or highly qualified graduates, look for the people who are already motivated by the same reasons as you are and inspire them even more. Who would you rather have
                            working for you? Excel pro Johnny, who’s only here to collect his consulting fee, or Lisa, who needs some time to learn, but wants to see the world change in the same way you do?

                        <p>Lesson 1: The biggest leaps in progress are vertical, not horizontal. Can you imagine what the year 2200 will look like? It’s hard, isn’t it? That’s because you know the world is making tremendous progress every year, but it’s
                            almost impossible to know what that will look like. But not all progress is created equal. Most of the progress we see on a day-to-day basis is horizontal. This kind of progress spreads existing ideas and technologies from
                            one to many or 1 to n. An example would be Apple making the computer personal – with the Apple II it finally became affordable for the masses to own one. Vertical progress is what it takes to go from zero to one and create
                            the technology or idea in the first place. Apple did this too when they came up with the iPhone in 2007 and changed the way we see and use phones altogether.</p>
                        <p>
                            Lesson 2: Monopolies aren’t bad. They’re good. For business, and society. How often have you complained about something not working the way you want it on a Windows computer? Don’t tell me, I’ve been a Microsoft user, I know. With 75% of the market running
                            on Windows, they’re pretty much a monopoly – but is that really a bad thing? No! Peter Thiel says that a monopoly simply means one company is doing something so much better than everyone else, that simply no one else can survive.
                            This is actually good for everyone. Think about Google. You love to use Google, because you know it’s the best search engine out there. Google loves setting its own prices and reaping 25% of their revenue as profit, so it can
                            make its service even better. And society should love it, because if ever someone came along and did beat Google,

                        <h3><a href="article.html">The One Thing <i class="fas fa-user"></i>  Gary W. Keller and Jayjay Papasan</a></h3>
                        <p> Lesson 1: You only need one question to figure out your priorities, both long-term and short-term. If you only take away a single sentence from this book, let it be this one: “What’s the ONE thing I can do, such that by doing it
                            everything else will become easier or unnecessary?” That’s what Keller calls the focusing question and it’s the core concept around which the entire book is built. Much like Tim Ferriss, Keller is a big fan of the 80/20 or
                            Pareto principle, where 20% of the input gives you 80% of the results. Not all items on your to-do list are created equal, so in order to make the biggest leaps in the shortest amount of time, you’d be best off ruthlessly prioritizing
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lesson 2: Getting focused means learning to say no. I wish I had a dime for every time anyone quoted Steve Jobs on something, because I’d probably be richer than the man himself was within a year. The man’s advice is just too good. At the 1997 WWDC (Worldwide
                            Developers Conference), Steve said that “you’d think focus means saying yes, but it actually means to say no.” When he returned to Apple he cut the product lineup from 350 to 10. He said no 340 times. That’s a lot of no’s.
                            But look at what the few Apple products we know today have become, and you’ll see he was right. Asking the focusing question is the easy part. Saying no to all your other seemingly important and urgent to-do’s is what’s hard.
                            The best way to make saying no easy is to make yourself unnecessary in the first place. For example if employees bother you with the same questions, create an FAQ and direct people to that.
