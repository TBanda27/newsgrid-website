                    <p>This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.</p>
                    <p>For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals
                        in six games and claim his third NBA Finals MVP award with three teams.</p>
                    <p>Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who dealt with the enormous anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at
                        Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.</p>
                    <p>It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.</p>
                    <p>They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise — and against the Heat franchise that showed him to become a champion.</p>

                    <p>Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler — the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention. Rajon Rondo scored 19 points for the Lakers.</p>

                    <p>The Lakers said they were playing the rest of the season in his memory. They delivered what Bryant did five times for L.A. — a ring, and the clincher was emphatic.Game 6 was over by halftime, the Lakers taking a 64-36 lead into the
                        break. The Heat never led and couldn't shoot from anywhere: 35% from 2-point range in the half, 33% from 3-point range and even an uncharacteristic 42% from the line, not like any of it really mattered. The Lakers were getting
                        everything they wanted and then some, outscoring Miami 36-16 in the second quarter and doing all that with James making just one shot in the period.</p>
                    <p>
                        Rajon Rondo, now a two-time champion and the first to win rings as a player in both Boston and Los Angeles — the franchises now tied with 17 titles apiece — was 6 for 6 in the half, the first time he'd done that since November 2007. The Lakers' lead was
                        46-32 with 5:00 left in the half, and they outscored Miami 18-4 from there until intermission. Ball game. The 28-point halftime lead was the second-biggest in NBA Finals history, topped only by the Celtics leading the Lakers 79-49
                        on May 27, 1985. True to form, the Heat — a No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference that finished with a losing record last season, a team that embraced the challenge of the bubble like none other — didn't stop playing, not even when
                        the deficit got to 36 in the third quarter.
